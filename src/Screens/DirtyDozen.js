                            It is a pesticide that was mainly used in WWII and crops. It helped control diseases spread by insects. It is very stable and persistent, staying in soil for 10-15 years, along with its widespread use can make it found in a lot of places. It has serious long-term chronic health effects and with its spread in vast amounts of food, food-borne DDT is the greatest source of exposure.

                            Pesticide for termites and textile pests, insect-borne diseases and for crops. Its half-life in soil is around five years. Aldrin rapidly composes into Dieldrin, so stopping direct use of Dieldrin wonâ€™t stop its spread. Dieldrin residues have been found in air, water, soil, fish, birds, and mammals, including humans. It is highly toxic to aquatic animals with only low doses. Primarily spread through food.

Eating food with HCB can lead to a variety of symptoms, including photosensitive skin lesions, colic, debilitation, and it can cause metabolic disorders. It is lethal to some animals at high doses and leads to decline in reproductive success at low doses.

The half-lives can range from 10 days to 1.5 years. They are lethal at high doses to fish and lead to reproductive failure and immunosuppression in various wild animals. It can cause various symptoms in humans, including pigmentation of nails and mucous membranes, swelling of the eyelids, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and developmental and behavioral problems in children.

                        It is a by-product unintentionally produced due to incomplete combustion, manufacturing pesticides and other substances. They are edited mainly from burning hospitals, municipal and hazardous waste and from specific natural fuels. There are 75 types of PCDD. Seven are of main cons=cern, with one of them having a half-life of 10-12 years. They have several harmful effects in humans, such as immune and enzyme disorders and possibly being a human carcinogen. It is lethal to fish and lead to symptoms, like birth defects and death, in certain animals. Food is the major exposure of this chemical.
